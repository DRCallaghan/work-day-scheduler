  ## Description:
  - I built this project to create an easy to use hourly scheduler for work days.
  - This app solves the problem of not being able to keep up with busy days.
  - I learned to be very careful with my logic and syntax during this project.
  - My project stands out for its simple design and clean UI.

  ## Installation:
  There are no installation steps; you can use a [live deployment](https://drcallaghan.github.io/work-day-scheduler/) instead.

  ## Usage:
  Usage is as simple as typing in whatever you need to do during an hour and saving it!
